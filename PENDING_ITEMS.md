## 1. âœ… BLOCKERS RESOLVED

### 1.1 CRM Database Access - âœ… SOLVED

**Original Issue**: Needed Peter's CRM database access to store/retrieve debtor records

**Solution**: **Google Sheets Interim CRM**
- Created "BCS_Debtors" Google Sheet with full schema
- n8n native integration (read/write via Google Sheets node)
- Peter can view/edit data in real-time

### 1.2 Call Scripts - âœ… SOLVED

**Original Issue**: Needed finalized call scripts from Peter for Vapi configuration

**Solution**: **Draft Scripts from Letter Templates**
- Using Letter of Demand templates as basis
- Drafting consumer + commercial scripts (1st/2nd/3rd calls)
- Vapi assistants can be updated in 5 minutes (scripts are just configuration)
- Will refine scripts with Peter's feedback after first test calls

**Status**: âœ… NO LONGER BLOCKING

## 3. Decisions Needed from Peter

### 3.1 Phone Number for Outbound Calls

**Question**: Should the AI bot use:
- **Option A**: Vapi-provided Australian phone number (instant setup, $10/month)
- **Option B**: Existing BCS phone number (requires porting, 2-4 weeks, may disrupt current usage)

**Recommendation**: Use Vapi number for Phase 1 (faster, safer)

**Urgency**: ðŸ”´ High - Need decision by Oct 5

**Status**: PENDING

---

### 3.2 Human Escalation Protocol

**Question**: When AI bot needs to escalate to a human, what should happen?

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Transfer call to Peter's mobile (requires Vapi call forwarding setup)
- **Option B**: End call and leave callback number for BCS
- **Option C**: Flag for manual review, BCS calls debtor back later

**Recommendation**: Option C for Phase 1 (simpler, no real-time human availability needed)

**Urgency**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium - Need decision by Oct 14

**Status**: PENDING

---

### 3.3 Business Hours & Timezone

**Question**: Confirm calling hours and timezone

**Assumptions**:
- Weekdays: 7:30am - 9:00pm
- Weekends: 9:00am - 9:00pm
- Timezone: AEST (or ACST depending on debtor location)

**Need to confirm**:
- Are debtors across multiple Australian timezones?
- Should system detect debtor timezone from phone area code?
- Any exceptions (e.g., no Sunday calls)?

**Urgency**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium - Need confirmation by Oct 9

**Status**: PENDING

---

### 3.4 Call Volume Estimate

**Question**: How many calls per day/week expected once system is live?

**Needed for**:
- Vapi plan selection (concurrent call limits)
- Cost estimation (per-minute charges)
- Database scaling

**Urgency**: ðŸŸ¢ Low - Nice to have for capacity planning

**Status**: PENDING

---

### 3.5 Timezone Handling Approach (NEW)

**Question**: How should the system handle debtors across multiple Australian timezones?

**Background**: Australia has 3 main timezones (AEST, ACST, AWST). Calling 7:30am Sydney time = 5:00am Perth time (non-compliant).

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Add `timezone` column to Google Sheets (Peter manually sets for each debtor)
- **Option B**: Auto-detect from phone area code (complex, error-prone)
- **Option C**: Assume all debtors in single timezone (risky if debtors nationwide)

**Recommendation**: Option A (explicit timezone column)

**Urgency**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium - Need decision by Oct 9

**Status**: PENDING

---

### 3.6 Attempt Number Increment Policy (NEW)

**Question**: Should attempt_number increment on every call or only successful contacts?

**Scenario**: 1st call â†’ NO_ANSWER â†’ retry in 4 hours â†’ is this still attempt 1 or attempt 2?

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Every call counts (NO_ANSWER increments attempt_number)
  - **Pros**: Safer, limits total calls to debtor (max 3 calls regardless of outcome)
  - **Cons**: Debtor with genuine unavailability gets fewer chances
- **Option B**: Only answered calls count
  - **Pros**: More persistent, better contact rate
  - **Cons**: Risk of harassment if debtor genuinely unavailable

**Recommendation**: Option A (every call counts - safer for compliance)

**Urgency**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium - Need decision by Oct 9

**Status**: PENDING

---

### 3.7 Call Recording Retention (NEW)

**Question**: How long should call recordings be kept?

**Options**:
- **Vapi default**: 7-30 days (included in plan)
- **Extended retention**: Download recordings to DigitalOcean Spaces (Phase 2 feature)
- **Compliance requirement**: May require 7 years for Australian debt collection

**Recommendation**: Use Vapi 30-day default for Phase 1, implement long-term archival in Phase 2 if required

**Urgency**: ðŸŸ¢ Low - Nice to have for Phase 1

**Status**: PENDING

---

## 4. Optional / Nice to Have

### 4.1 CRM Screenshots or Demo

**Request**: Screenshots or demo of current CRM interface

**Purpose**:
- Understand workflow
- Design better integration
- Plan future CRM rebuild (Phase 3) if needed

**Urgency**: ðŸŸ¢ Low - Not critical

**Status**: PENDING

---

### 4.2 Sample Debtor Records (Anonymized)

**Request**: 5-10 sample debtor records (names/details anonymized)

**Purpose**:
- Test data structure
- Build realistic test scenarios
- Validate database integration

**Format**: CSV, Excel, or database export

**Urgency**: ðŸŸ¢ Low - Can use synthetic data

**Status**: PENDING

---

### 4.3 Existing Call Recordings (if any)

**Request**: Recordings of actual debt collection calls (if BCS staff have made any)

**Purpose**:
- Understand tone and pacing
- Identify common objections
- Improve AI bot realism

**Urgency**: ðŸŸ¢ Low - Nice to have for refinement

**Status**: PENDING
